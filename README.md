# Homer's Computer
This was some (partially) quick experimentation done for potential site takeover features for a collaboration between Eastpak and The Simpsons.

As a long-time Simpsons fanatic, I jumped at the chance to come up with appropriately wacky interactions that tapped into the series' love of deep and obscure references. While the project ended up going in a different direction, I'm really proud of how this turned out.

The code certainly isn't the cleanest I've written, as it was done very much on the fly to create a proof of concept. I said it was "partially" quick above because the bulk of my time and effort was spent lovingly creating the SVGs of Homer's computer, the pig, and the Mr. Sparkle box (see s07e07, "King-Size Homer"; s07e05, "Lisa the Vegetarian"; and s08e22, "In Marge We Trust."

To view it in action, check out https://codepen.io/karpar/pen/dyjEoNJ - click the computer's screen and type one of the following, then hit enter: BBBQ, FISHBULB, BLINKY

Had the concept been approved, more (and more _obvious_) codewords would have been added, each with its accompanying animation or effect, along with a careful social media push to entice Simpsons super-fans to discover all of the possibilities.
